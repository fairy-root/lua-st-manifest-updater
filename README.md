## Features

*   **File Input:** Select `.lua` or `.st` files via a file dialog or drag-and-drop.
*   **Game ID Extraction:** Automatically extracts the Steam Game ID from the selected `.lua` file.
*   **Steam Game Info:** Fetches and displays the game's capsule image and description based on the extracted Game ID. Includes a retry option on fetch errors.
*   **Repository Selection:**
    *   Allows selection of different source repositories for game manifests via a dropdown menu.
    *   The dropdown is populated from a `repo.json` configuration file (see Configuration section).
    *   The "default" repository path specified in `repo.json` is selected by default in standard mode.
*   **Standard Mode Manifest Download:**
    *   Downloads the latest manifest archive (`.zip`) for the specific game ID from the selected repository (with a proxy fallback).
    *   Extracts `.manifest` files from the downloaded archive.
*   **Special Mode (Direct Manifest Download):**
    *   Activated by a checkbox, which is **enabled by default**.
    *   When active, the repository dropdown is disabled.
    *   Fetches a list of all `depotid` and `manifestid` pairs for the given `game_id`.
    *   Attempts to download each manifest file (named `{depotid}_{manifestid}.manifest`).
*   **Lua File Update:** Updates the manifest IDs within the provided `.lua` or `.st` file using the information from the obtained manifests (either extracted from a zip in standard mode or downloaded directly in special mode).
*   **Output Generation:** Creates a new `.zip` archive containing the updated `.lua` or `.st` file (renamed to `<game_id>.lua`) and the relevant `.manifest` files.
*   **Custom Output:** Allows specifying a custom output directory (defaults to `Updated Files` on the Desktop).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides clear status updates and error messages throughout the process via GUI.
*   **Error Handling:** Manages potential issues like invalid file types, network errors during download, problems during extraction, or missing Game IDs.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fairy-root/lua-st-manifest-updater.git
cd lua-st-manifest-updater
```

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Configuration

The application uses a `repo.json` file in its root directory to manage repository sources for manifest downloads in Standard Mode.

**`repo.json` Structure:**

```json
{
  "FairyRoot": "Fairyvmos/BlankTMing",
  "AnotherRepoName": "username/another-repo",
  "YetAnother": "someuser/some-repo"
}
```

*   `"default"`: (Required) Specifies the default repository path (e.g., `"username/repository"`) to be used. The application will attempt to select a key from the list that matches this path. If no direct key matches this path, this path itself will be added as an option and selected.
*   Other keys (e.g., `"AnotherRepoName"`, `"YetAnother"`): These are user-defined names that will appear in the repository selection dropdown. The value is the GitHub repository path (`"username/repository"`).

If `repo.json` is not found, a default one will be created:
```json
{
  "FairyRoot": "Fairyvmos/BlankTMing"
}
```

## Usage

**Run the Tool**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

1.  **Select Lua/St File**: Use the "Select File" button or drag and drop your `.lua` or `.st` file onto the designated area. The application will attempt to extract the Game ID and display game information.
2.  **Choose Operating Mode**:
    *   **Special Mode (Default)**: The "Special Mode (Direct Manifest Download)" checkbox is enabled by default. In this mode, manifests are fetched directly based on `depot_id` and `manifest_id` and downloaded from a dedicated repository. The repository dropdown will be disabled.
    *   **Standard Mode**: Uncheck the "Special Mode" checkbox. The repository dropdown will become active. Select your desired source repository from the dropdown. Manifests will be downloaded as a zip archive from this selected repository.
3.  **Select Output Folder**: (Optional) Click "Browse" to choose a custom folder for the updated files. Defaults to `Updated Files` on your Desktop.
4.  **Update**: Click the "Update" button to start the process.
5.  Follow the status messages for progress and any errors.
